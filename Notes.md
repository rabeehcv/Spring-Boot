## Spring

"Spring" is a broad term that encompasses the entire ecosystem of projects and tools developed by the Spring community.
Some key projects under the Spring umbrella include:

- Spring Framework: The core framework providing the foundation for dependency injection, AOP (Aspected oriented programming), etc. It is used to build various types of applications, including web applications, microservices, batch processing. Requires a server to be deployed(eg. Tomcat). Dependencies are manually managed.

- Spring Boot: Simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with minimal configuration. It is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with Spring Framework faster and easier. It is a standalone application with embedded server. Auto configuration based on classpath dependencies. It has built in production ready features(Actuators - to monitor and manage application health,etc). Spring Boot allows spring applications to run as standalone application which will be packaged as executable jars along with embedded server(eg. Tomcat). Spring Boot Starter will provides a set of convenient dependency descriptors to include a bundle of related dependencies(Eg. spring-boot-starter-data-jpa includes dependencies for JPA and Hibernate). It supprots embedded server, so that we dont have to deploy to an external server.

- Spring Data: Simplifies data access, provides repositories, and supports various data stores like JPA, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.

- Spring Security: Provides comprehensive security services for applications.

- Spring Cloud: Offers tools for building distributed systems and microservices.

- Spring Batch: managing large volumes of records and job scheduling.

### Annotations

- @ComponentScan is a powerful annotation in Spring Framework used to automatically detect and register Spring-managed components (like beans, controllers, services, repositories, etc.) within a specified package or set of packages. @ComponentScan is used to tell Spring which packages to scan for components. Spring searches for classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, or other stereotypes within the specified packages and their subpackages. Found components are automatically registered as beans(a Java object that forms the backbone of a Spring application.) in the Spring application context, making them available for dependency injection.

- @SpringBootApplication is a composite annotation in Spring Boot that simplifies the setup of a Spring application. It's a convenient way to enable auto-configuration, component scanning, and configuration property binding in a single step.
  Internally, @SpringBootApplication is composed of three main annotations:

@Configuration: Marks the class as a configuration class, allowing it to define beans.

@ComponentScan: Enables component scanning to automatically discover and register components (like services, repositories, controllers) as Spring beans.

@EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism, which automatically configures beans based on classpath dependencies.

- @RestController is a specialized annotation in Spring Framework primarily used for developing RESTful web services(RESTful Web Service is a type of web service that follows the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style). It serves as a convenient shorthand for combining two other annotations:

@Controller: Indicates that the class is a controller, capable of handling web requests.

@ResponseBody: Specifies that the return value of methods should be directly written to the response body, instead of rendering a view.

```
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

The GreetingController is annotated with @RestController.

The greeting method is annotated with @GetMapping to handle GET requests to the /greeting endpoint.

The method returns a simple string, which will be converted to JSON and sent as the response body.

- @Autowired - to get instance of the class. While @Autowired can be used to create an instance of a class, it's more accurate to say that it's used to inject an existing instance of a class into another class.
- @Repository - specialization of @Component annotation and is used to indicate that the class provides mechanicsm for storage, retrieval, update, delete and search operation on objects.
- @Entity -  to map domain objects to relational database tables. Marks a class as a database table.
- @Getter - Generates a getter method for a field.
- @Setter - Generates a setter method for a field.
- @Table: Maps a Java class to a database table. Allows customization of table name and schema, essential for complex database structures.
- @Column: Maps a Java field to a database column. Enables precise mapping of fields to columns, including column name, data type, and constraints.
- @Id - marks a field as a primary key of an entity.
- @GeneratedValue: Automatically generates values for primary key fields.
- @PrePersist: used on a method to indicate that it should be called before an entity is persisted to the database.
- @RequestMapping: used to map HTTP requests to handler methods in a controller.
- @PostMapping("/create"): This annotation defines a POST HTTP method endpoint with the path /create.
- @GetMapping("/findall"): This annotation defines a GET HTTP method endpoint with the path /findall.
- @GetMapping("/findbyid/{id}"): This annotation defines a GET HTTP method endpoint with the path /findbyid/{id}. The {id} part is a path variable.
- @PatchMapping("/update"): This annotation defines a PATCH HTTP method endpoint with the path /update.
- @DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}"): This annotation defines a DELETE HTTP method endpoint with the path /delete/{id}. The {id} part is a path variable.
- @Component: This annotation from Spring indicates that this class is a component and can be managed by the Spring container. This means it's eligible for autowiring into other components.
- @Service - to mark a class as a service provider, in which the class will provide business functionalities.
- @Query Annotation: This annotation tells Spring Data JPA that the following method defines a custom JPQL query instead of relying on the default methods provided by JpaRepository.
- @EnableJpaAuditing: By adding @EnableJpaAuditing to main application class, you enable JPA auditing for your entire Spring Boot application.
- @EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class) in entity class to ensure that the auditing fields are automatically populated.
- @CreatedDate: This annotation is used on a field to automatically store the timestamp when an entity is created.
- @LastModifiedDate: This annotation is used on a field to automatically store the timestamp when an entity is last modified.
- @CreatedBy: This annotation is used on a field to automatically store the user who created the entity (requires AuditorAware).
- @LastModifiedBy: This annotation is used on a field to automatically store the user who last modified the entity (requires AuditorAware).
- @Document: to mark a Java class as a MongoDB document, meaning that instances of the class will be mapped to documents in a MongoDB collection.
- @Data: combines several commonly used annotations(such as @Getter, @Setter, @toString, etc) into one.
- @AllArgsConstructor: Generates a constructor that takes arguments for all fields in the class, allowing to initialize an instance with all properties set.
- @NoArgsConstructor: generates a no-argument constructor for class.
- @DocumentReference: to create references between documents in different collections (similar to foreign key relationships in relational databases).
- @EnableWebSecurity: This annotation is used to enable Spring Securityâ€™s web security capabilities in the application. It tells Spring that this class contains the configuration for web security. Use @EnableWebSecurity for configuring web security (securing HTTP requests).
- @Enumerated: used with fields that are of an enum type. It tells the persistence provider (like Hibernate in a Spring application) how to store the enum values in the database.
- @EnableMethodSecurity is used when you want to secure individual methods within your services or controllers, providing finer control over security. Use @EnableMethodSecurity for enabling method-level security (securing service or controller methods). This allows us to use security annotations like @PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize, @Secured, and others on methods to control access based on roles, permissions, or other criteria.


### Steps to follow

1. Go to Spring Initializr
2. Choose the options of your preference. For Example, Select Project -> Maven , Language -> Java, Spring Boot -> 3.3.2, Group Id -> (to whome this project belogs to, eg. com.personal), Artifact -> (project name), Packaging -> Jar, Version -> 17 , Dependencies (Spring web, spring boot actuator, etc)
3. Click Generate.
4. Extract zip file to the path of your choice.
5. Open IntelliJ and File -> Open -> (choose path)
6. Make sure java version is 17 on your project structure. File -> Project structure -> Project -> SDK -> JDK 17 version
7. Run
8. Go to browser and enter port such as, http://localhost:8080/("ending" such as "user" if you have provided @GetMapping("/user") in the controller component,)(you can view port number on console or can change it on application.properties file on resources by : server.port = 9001)
9. Using actuators, go to browser and search , localhost:8080/actuator/health (for further, paste the code on application.properties: management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=info,health,metrics,loggers,env,beans,mappings and search localhost:8080/actuator/env)

### Dependencies
- Spring web - provides essential components for building web applications, including RESTful services. It simplifies the setup process by automatically including necessary dependencies and configurations.
- Lombok - Java library that helps you reduce boilerplate code. It provides annotations that generate commonly used code snippets like getters, setters, constructors,etc. 
- Spring Data JPA - for using Spring Data JPA in Spring Boot application.
- Spring Data MongoDB - provides support for integrating MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, with Spring-based applications.
- Spring Boot DevTools - to enhance the development experience by providing a set of tools. These tools streamline the development workflow, offering features like automatic restarts, live reload, and enhanced logging.
### Spring Boot JPA
- For managing relational data in our java application.
- Allows to access and persist data between java objects/classes and realtional database.
- It follows Object-Relation Mapping(ORM).
- Provides runtime EntityManager API for processing queries and transaction on the object against database.
- Uses JPQL(Java Persistent Query Language).

### Additional Notes
#### When We Might Need a No-Argument Constructor in our entity class
If we Add a Parameterized Constructor that takes arguments (e.g., to initialize fields at creation), Java will stop generating the default no-argument constructor. In such cases, we might want to explicitly include a no-argument constructor if some frameworks or libraries (like JPA) require it.
Framework Requirements: Some frameworks like JPA expect a no-argument constructor to be present to create instances of the entity class through reflection. However, Java automatically generates one unless we provide another constructor.

### Key components of a Spring Boot Application
#### Entities
- Represent data objects that correspond to database tables.
- Annotated with @Entity for JPA to recognize them.
- Examples: User, Product, Order.
#### Repositories
- Provide a mechanism to interact with the database.
- Annotated with @Repository.
- Define methods for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Often use Spring Data JPA for implementation.
- Example: UserRepository, ProductRepository.
##### Note : Optional is a container class in Java that represents a value which may or may not be present. It provides a safe way to handle potential null values.
#### Controllers
- Handle incoming requests and return responses.
- Define endpoints and map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Coordinate interactions between the view, service, and repository layers.
- Annotated with @Controller or @RestController.
- Example: UserController, ProductController.
#### Models
- Represent data structures used for transferring data between layers.
- Not strictly required but can improve code organization.
- Example: UserDto, ProductDto.
#### Services
- Contain business logic.
- Annotated with @Service.
- Example: UserService, ProductService.

### ResponseEntity
A Spring class that represents the whole HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body
### Dependency injection
- Dependency injection is used to make a class independent of its dependencies or to create a looselyÂ coupled program.
- It means that a class doesn't create its dependencies itself, but receives them from an external source.
- Loose coupling implies that components can be changed independently without affecting other components.
- Useful forÂ improving the reusability of code.

### Hibernate
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java that is often used in Spring Boot applications to maps Java objects to database tables and vice versa. Automatically generate SQL queries based on the mappings and execute them

### Spring Security
- GrantedAuthority and SimpleGrantedAuthority are Spring Security classes that represent the roles and permissions granted to the user.
- UserDetails is an interface provided by Spring Security that provides the necessary information to build an Authentication object.Defines methods for retrieving user-specific data.

#### getAuthority() 
```
@Override
public Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities() {
    return Collections.singleton(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_" + role.name()));
}
```
getAuthorities() method in the CustomUserDetails class is used to return the roles (or authorities) assigned to the user. The method constructs a SimpleGrantedAuthority object that encapsulates the role, prefixes it with "ROLE_", and returns it within a Set. This setup allows Spring Security to manage access control based on the roles assigned to the user.

#### Security Configuration
- The SecurityConfig class  annotated with @Configuration and @EnableMethodSecurity means it's a configuration class that enables Spring Security's method-level security features.
```
csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
```
Disables Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. CSRF protection is crucial for stateful web applications that use cookies for session management. However, it is often disabled for REST APIs since they are typically stateless and do not use sessions.
```
authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth...)
```
Specifies how requests to the application are authorized.
```
.requestMatchers("/users/create", "/auth/**").permitAll()
```
Allows anyone to access the /users/create and /auth/** endpoints without authentication.
```
.anyRequest().authenticated()
```
Requires authentication for any other request to the application.
```
.sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))
```
Configures how sessions are managed in the application.

SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS: Ensures that no HTTP session is created or used by Spring Security. This is typical for stateless REST APIs where each request should contain all necessary information for authentication (e.g., via tokens).
```
httpBasic()
```
Enables HTTP Basic authentication. In Basic Authentication, the client sends the username and password with every request, typically encoded in a base64 format in the Authorization header.
```
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}
```
The @Bean annotation tells Spring that this method returns an object that should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context. Beans are managed by Spring, and they can be injected into other parts of your application using dependency injection. 

The method will return an instance of the PasswordEncoder interface, which is a Spring Security interface for encoding passwords.

Returns a new instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder, which is an implementation of the PasswordEncoder interface, to hash passwords using the BCrypt hashing algorithm.
